This course will investigate the semantics of generic sentences, i.e., sentences that are used to talk about habits, tendencies, dispositions, or kinds. For instance:

1.  Dogs are good pets.
2.  The giant panda is an endangered species.
3.  A soccer player makes lots of money.
4.  Mary smokes after dinner.
5.  This machine crushes oranges.

This is a half-semester course.
